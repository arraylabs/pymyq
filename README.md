# Introduction

This is a Python 3.8+ module aiming to interact with the Chamberlain MyQ API.

Code is licensed under the MIT license.

# [Homeassistant](https://home-assistant.io)

[Homeassistant](https://home-assistant.io) has a [core myQ component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/myq/) leveraging this package.
In addition, there is also a [HACS myQ component](https://github.com/ehendrix23/hass_myq) available that can be added into HACS as a custom repository.

# Getting Started

## Installation

```shell
pip install pymyq
```

## Usage

`pymyq` starts within an [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
`ClientSession`:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
      # YOUR CODE HERE


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

To get all MyQ devices associated with an account:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

import pymyq


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
      myq = await pymyq.login('<EMAIL>', '<PASSWORD>', websession)

      # Return only cover devices:
      devices = myq.covers
      # >>> {"serial_number123": <Device>}

      # Return only lamps devices:
      devices = myq.lamps
      # >>> {"serial_number123": <Device>}

      # Return only locks devices:
      devices = myq.locks
      # >>> {"serial_number123": <Device>}

      # Return only gateway devices:
      devices = myq.gateways
      # >>> {"serial_number123": <Device>}

      # Return *all* devices:
      devices = myq.devices
      # >>> {"serial_number123": <Device>, "serial_number456": <Device>}


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

## API Properties

- `accounts`: dictionary with all accounts (MyQAccount)
- `covers`: dictionary with all covers (MyQGarageDoor)
- `devices`: dictionary with all devices (MyQDevice)
- `gateways`: dictionary with all gateways (MyQDevice)
- `lamps`: dictionary with all lamps (MyQLamp)
- `locks`: dictionary with all locks (MyQLock)
- `last_state_update`: datetime (in UTC) last state update was retrieved for all items
- `password`: password used for authentication. Can only be set, not retrieved
- `username`: username for authentication.

## Account Properties (MyQAccount)

- `api`: Associated API object
- `id`: ID for the account
- `name`: Name of the account
- `covers`: dictionary with all covers for account (MyQGarageDoor)
- `devices`: dictionary with all devices for account (MyQDevice)
- `gateways`: dictionary with all gateways for account (MyQDevice)
- `lamps`: dictionary with all lamps for account (MyQLamp)
- `locks`: dictionary with all locks for account (MyQLock)
- `account_json`: Dictionary containing all account information as retrieved from MyQ
- `last_state_update`: datetime (in UTC) last state update was retrieved for all devices within this account

## Device Properties

- `account`: Return account associated with device (MyQAccount)
- `close_allowed`: Return whether the device can be closed unattended.
- `device_family`: Return the family in which this device lives.
- `device_id`: Return the device ID (serial number).
- `device_json`: Dictionary containing all device information as retrieved from MyQ
- `device_platform`: Return the device platform.
- `device_type`: Return the device type.
- `firmware_version`: Return the family in which this device lives.
- `href`: URI for device
- `name`: Return the device name.
- `online`: Return whether the device is online.
- `open_allowed`: Return whether the device can be opened unattended.
- `parent_device_id`: Return the device ID (serial number) of this device's parent.
- `state`: Return the current state of the device.
- `state_update`: Returns datetime when device was last updated
- `low_battery`: Returns if the garage has a low battery or not.

## API Methods

These are coroutines and need to be `await`ed – see `example.py` for examples.

- `authenticate`: Authenticate (or re-authenticate) to MyQ. Call this to
  re-authenticate immediately after changing username and/or password otherwise
  new username/password will only be used when token has to be refreshed.
- `update_device_info`: Retrieve info and status for all accounts and devices

## Account Methods

All of the routines on the `MyQAccount` class are coroutines and need to be
`await`ed – see `example.py` for examples.

- `update`: get the latest device info (state, etc.) for all devices associated with this account.

## Device Methods

All of the routines on the `MyQDevice` class are coroutines and need to be
`await`ed – see `example.py` for examples.

- `update`: get the latest device info (state, etc.). Note that
  this runs MyQAccount.update and thus all devices within account will be updated

## Cover Methods

All Device methods in addition to:

- `close`: close the cover
- `open`: open the cover

## Lamp Methods

All Device methods in addition to:

- `turnon`: turn lamp on
- `turnoff`: turn lamp off
